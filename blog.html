        <p class="text-2xl py-5">
          Var: <br>
           Function Scope: Variables declared with var have function-level scope. This means they are only accessible within the function in which they are declared, regardless of where within the function they are defined. <br><br>

          Let: <br>
          Block Scope: Variables declared with let have block-level scope, meaning they are limited to the block (enclosed by curly braces) in which they are defined. This includes if statements, loops, and functions <br> <br>

          Const: <br>
          Block Scope: cons have also block Scope.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-red-500">Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h2>
        <p class="text-2xl py-5">
          Null: If there has no meaningful value then its explicitly indicates null 

          undefined:  represents the absence of an assigned value and is typically used when a variable or property has not been given a value, either explicitly or implicitly.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-red-500">What do you mean by REST API?</h2>
        <p class="text-2xl py-5">REST API is a collection of guidelines and practices for developing and utilizing HTTP to communicate with web services. It carries out operations including data retrieval, creation, update, and deletion using resource-based URLs, stateless communication, and normal HTTP methods. Data communication between clients and servers using scalable and standardized RESTful APIs is common.</p>
